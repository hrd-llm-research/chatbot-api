Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. He developed an interest in computing and programming at an early age and taught himself computer programming. He moved to Canada in 1992 to attend college, and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated with a degree in economics and physics.

After graduating, Musk moved to California to pursue a career in technology and entrepreneurship. He co-founded his first company, Zip2, which provided online content publishing software for news organizations.

He also founded Tesla, Inc. in 2003, with the goal of accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy.
